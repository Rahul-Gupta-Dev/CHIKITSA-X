# CHIKITSAX — AI-Powered Patient Intelligence, Care Navigation & Financial Assistance Platform

> **Tagline:** *"From Symptoms to Care, From Care to Financial Support."*  
> **Target:** Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Full-Stack Working Prototype

---

## 📌 Executive Summary & Core Idea

CHIKITSAX is not merely a hospital search directory. It is a **Care-to-Cost Decision & Navigation Platform** designed to solve two massive healthcare challenges in India:

1. **Clinical Fragmentation:** Patients struggle to understand symptoms, organize physical medical records, and find the right hospital specialty.
2. **Financial Catastrophe:** Out-of-pocket medical expenses push millions of Indian families into poverty due to a lack of awareness regarding health insurance, **Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY**, state health schemes, and NGO funds.

CHIKITSAX unifies the entire patient journey:
```
Patient Login → AI Voice Intake → Medical Record Upload (OCR) → Unified Health Profile → 
AI Clinical Triage → CHIKITSAX Care Score Hospital Recommendation → OPD Registration → 
Reference ID Generation → Secure QR Pass → Hospital Check-in Verification → Patient Consent → 
Doctor Consultation → Treatment Cost Estimate → Insurance + Gov Scheme + NGO Matching → 
Care-to-Cost Financial Gap Calculation → AI Finance Scenario Planner
```

## 🚀 Key Differentiators & Features

### 1. 🎙️ AI Voice Symptom Intake
- Integrated Web Speech API for natural voice input in English & regional Indian languages.
- Fallback sample transcripts for instant hackathon demonstrations.
- Automatically extracts structured metrics: Symptoms, Duration, Severity, and Affected Body Part with explicit AI safety disclaimers.

### 2. 📄 Medical Record Upload & OCR Engine
- Multi-format document uploader (PDF, JPG, PNG) supporting Prescriptions, Lab Reports, Discharge Summaries, and Radiology Reports.
- Simulated multi-step OCR extraction pipeline.
- **100% Editable extracted values** (Medicines, Diagnoses, Lab Metrics) before saving to the patient's unified record.

### 3. 🏥 CHIKITSAX Care Score Hospital Recommendation Engine
Ranks tertiary hospitals using a 5-vector transparent scoring algorithm:
$$\text{Care Score} = (\text{Clinical Fit} \times 35\%) + (\text{Affordability} \times 25\%) + (\text{Distance} \times 15\%) + (\text{Availability} \times 15\%) + (\text{Support Services} \times 10\%)$$
- Includes **"Why Recommended?"** transparent breakdown modals explaining exact weightings.
- Side-by-side hospital comparison matrix.

### 4. 🎟️ Digital OPD Pass & Secure Token QR Protocol
- Multi-step appointment booking producing a unique Reference ID (e.g. `CHX-2026-8A92F`).
- HTML5 Canvas QR Pass generator encoding **only encrypted reference tokens** — keeping sensitive raw medical data out of QR payloads for privacy.

### 5. 🔑 Hospital Staff Check-in & Patient Consent Protocol
- Hospital Admin / Reception Desk scanner to verify Reference IDs and check-in patients.
- Patient consent workflow: Hospital staff request record access $\rightarrow$ Patient receives an instant alert $\rightarrow$ Once approved, doctor unlocks full clinical history.

### 6. 🩺 Doctor Consultation Workspace & Cost Estimate Generator
- Doctor workspace displaying authorized patient symptoms, OCR records, and AI Triage.
- Itemized **Treatment Cost Estimate Generator** (Procedure, Room, Labs, Medications) yielding indicative cost ranges (e.g. ₹85,000 – ₹1,15,000).

### 7. 💳 Care-to-Cost Live Financial Gap Engine
Dynamic live formula calculating out-of-pocket exposure:
$$\text{Financial Gap} = \text{Treatment Cost} - \text{Insurance} - \text{PM-JAY Gov Scheme} - \text{NGO Aid} - \text{Patient Self Pay}$$
- Instant eligibility matching for **Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY**, **MJPJAY**, and NGO funds (Tata Trusts, Being Human Foundation, Smile Foundation).

### 8. 📊 AI Finance Scenario Planner
Side-by-side comparison engine evaluating multiple hospital cost pathways:
- **Scenario A:** Selected Tertiary Hospital (Net Gap: ₹15,000)
- **Scenario B:** AIIMS Public Referral (Net Gap: ₹0 — 100% Gov Subsidy)
- **Scenario C:** Empaneled Community Center (Net Gap: ₹0 — Zero Gap)

### 9. 🚨 Urgent Care Emergency Pathway
- Always-visible red **"EMERGENCY HELP"** button.
- Urgent Care Pathway modal providing emergency guidance, nearest 24/7 Trauma ICUs, distance, bed availability, direct phone dialer, and Google Maps directions.
